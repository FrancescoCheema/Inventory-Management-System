# Inventory-Management-System
This is the Inventory Management System Project for my college. Learning C# was quite fun and a lot of research had to go through it. However, I do have to say that my past experience with Javascript helped a lot, being able to use functions, if statements, || and && operators, converting toString() and TryParse() from my previous project, came very handy in this project.
